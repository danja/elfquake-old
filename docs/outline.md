## Proposition

It may be possible to predict some earthquakes with enough precision as to allow preparation by populations in the earthquake zone. The approach suggested here is to incorporate two new factors :

* Deep Learning
* Natural Radio Signals

Considerable work has been done using traditional statistical methods to try to predict earthquakes. In general, these endeavours been unsuccessful. But Deep Learning techniques offer a significant improvement in pattern recognition.

Unusual radio signals in the VLF range have sometimes been observed preceding earthquakes. The leading hypothesis is that these are generated by stresses in the geology causing the piezo effect, generating electricity and hence electromagnetic wave. (The actual mechanism is irrelevant here).

## System Architecture

### Novel Aspects

multimodal sensor data
continual training

### Inputs

* Seismic event data - from the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV), https://terremoti.ingv.it/
* VLF Signals - from monitoring stations listed at http://www.vlf.it/

### Outputs

* Record of predicted events (and possibly intermediate results) for training and evaluation
* Notification of significant predicted events (ultimately something like Twitter)
