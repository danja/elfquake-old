origin of electromagnetic precursors, expected to be generated well before

the occurrence of an earthquake, due to the process of rocks microfracture,

are presented and discussed. The wide frequency spectrum of electromagnetic

signals produced by the damped dipole oscillations caused by the microfracture

process is described. The propagation of low frequency electromagnetic

waves in the ELF and ULF range, belonging to such spectrum, is studied

with reference to the electrical properties of rocks constituting the lithosphere.

The characteristics and the possible propagation paths of such waves, both

underground and over the Earth surface, are considered. A method based

on the delay of reception between slow underground electromagnetic waves

and waves which travel in the atmosphere at about the light speed is proposed

in order to estimate the distance of the source of electromagnetic precursors

from the observing station and, hence, to locate the source by means of

a network of stations.</font></font></i>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma"><font color="#FF6600"><font size="+2">1. INTRODUCTION</font></font></font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">The occurrence of earthquakes is associated with

the release, in a short time interval, of a large quantity of energy coming

from a confined volume below the Earth surface.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">The linear dimensions of the focal region in most

earthquakes is of the order of few kilometres or even less, while, in large

magnitude earthquakes, may be greater. The focal region may be approximated,

for the purposes of the present work, to a source of spherical waves or

of cylindrical waves if one of the dimensions predominates over the others.

The centre of the focal region, referred to as the focus, is normally,

for shallow shocks, at depths less than 60 km which is about only 1% of

the Earth radius, although a small number of earthquakes have greater focal

depths. This is in agreement with the consideration that most ordinary

earthquakes appear to be originated above the Mohorovicic discontinuity,

which is placed at depths from about 30 to 60 km. Intermediate shocks originate

at depths between 60 and 300 km, while deep shocks originate at depths

greater than 300 km, with a maximum depth recorded of about 720 km. While

deep and intermediate shocks are limited to the circum-Pacific belt and

to the trans-Asiatic belt (Gutenberg, 1954), the region which extends from

Asia Minor to Italy, is usually interested mainly by shallow shocks; besides,

strong earthquakes are observed in the subduction region of the Hellenic

arc.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">The purposes of the present paper are: i) to discuss

an hypothesis on the possible mechanisms which could give rise to electromagnetic

waves from the focal region well before the appearance of shock waves,

ii) to describe the propagation of such waves in the Earth crust and their

refraction through the Earth/atmosphere boundary and, finally, iii) to

estimate the detectability of such waves with the aim of proposing their

use to determine the location and, possibly, the magnitude of impending

earthquakes.</font>

<p><font face="Tahoma"><font color="#FF6600"><font size="+2">2. ENERGY RELEASED

IN AN EARTHQUAKE</font></font></font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">The energy of an elastic wave of given frequency

is proportional to the square of the amplitude. Then, different earthquakes

at a fixed distance should have energy proportional to the square of the

recorded magnitude. For various reasons such a crude model does not fit

the experimental observations and an empirical relation has been found

between the magnitude of an earthquake and the total amount of energy released

in which the exponent is somewhat less than 2. The energy E, corresponding

to a magnitude M from body waves has been found to follow, to a first approximation,

the law</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma"><font color="#000066">log E = 5.24 + 1.44 M&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font><font color="#000000">

(1)</font></font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">where E is measured in joules (Båth, 1973).

Notice that eq. (1) is valid only for M &gt; 5 and should not be used for

lower magnitudes. A magnitude increase of one unit in the M-scale corresponds

to an energy increase by about 27 times. For M = 7 eq. (1) gives E </font><font face="Symbol">»

J. For smaller magnitudes, although an analytical expression is not available,

the energy released is obviously smaller, but nevertheless very large.

Such enormous energy amounts are accumulated, before an earthquake, in

the Earth’s crust geological structures during time intervals which are

often very long as compared to the human time scale, and stored as elastic

energy associated with the compression and deformation of rocks. This mechanical

energy is then released mainly in the short time during which the largest

shocks are produced, but part of it is spent in the microfracturing processes

of rocks before the rocks failure. In this work we are interested in the

various mechanisms and phenomena which precede the earthquake itself, which

could be useful as precursors signals of an impending earthquake. To this

purpose, since it is very difficult if not impossible to gain a direct

knowledge of the rocks behaviour under the real conditions in the Earth

crust, we will refer to laboratory experiments on the compression of rocks

and, from them, we will infer their behaviour in the Earth crust, being

well aware of the differences of conditions between the two cases mainly

as concerns the temperature and the water content of rocks and the way

in which stresses are applied. Rocks temperatures are usually higher in

the Earth crust than in laboratory experiments; the water content is greatly

influenced by the environmental conditions such as pressure; when rocks

are machined to a various degree, at atmospheric pressure, for laboratory

tests they are, consequently, more or less dehydrated; stresses can be

applied in every direction in the Earth crust, while in many laboratory

tests, for convenience, only uniaxial stresses are applied to rock samples.

Finally, in laboratory tests, simulation of tectonic conditions by applying

stresses at a convenient slow rate is not always possible. Nevertheless,

with due limitations, the overall behaviour of rocks in the Earth crust

can be deduced from laboratory experiments.</font>

</p><hr width="100%">

<p><font face="Tahoma"><font color="#FF6600"><font size="+2">3. ROCKS FRACTURE</font></font></font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">The successive stages which lead to fracture of

brittle materials, such as rocks, are the following: i) accumulation of

stress; ii) microfracturing; iii) dilatancy; iv) macroscopic breaking.

This last stage, connected with the sudden stress drop, leads to the crumbling

of the sample in laboratory tests; while, in the Earth crust, gives origin

to seismic waves. The applied compressive stress for which fracture occurs

in laboratory experiments depends on the speed at which the stress increases,

on the previous history of the samples and, of course, on the kind of rock

considered. For granite, e.g., a typical value is 2.3 </font><font face="Symbol">´</font><font face="Tahoma">

10<sup><font size="-1">8</font></sup> Pa (Reynolds, 1961), which is one of

the highest values observed. This stress corresponds to an energy density

U, stored in the sample before the fracture, of 2.3 </font><font face="Symbol">´</font><font face="Tahoma">

10<sup><font size="-1">8</font></sup> Jm-<sup><font size="-1">3</font></sup>.

If we assume that the average value of bond energy u for a single atomic

bond is about 2 eV, a rough estimate of the number N of atomic bonds per

unit volume at the rock crumbling in laboratory experiments can be obtained

as N = U/u </font><font face="Symbol">»</font><font face="Tahoma">

7.2 </font><font face="Symbol">´</font><font face="Tahoma"> 10<sup><font size="-1">26</font></sup>

m-<sup>3</sup>, which corresponds to about 3% of the total number of atomic

bonds in the rock.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">During stage i) the stress, usually, increases continuously

in naturally occurring phenomena. This stage can last many years up to

centuries, while in laboratory experiments its duration is determined by

the experimental set up and it is, obviously, considerably shorter. As

previously pointed out, the speed the applied stress grows is of relevance

for the dynamics of fracture and even for the final value of stress which

correspond to the macroscopic breaking.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">The microfracturing stage is the most interesting

one to the purpose of the present investigation. Measurements of wave velocity

and electrical resistivity (Mogi, 1973) indicate the formation of open

cracks, while various authors have detected acoustic and/or ultra-acoustic

emissions during stage ii) (Scholz, 1968); measurements of crack velocity

in norite (Bieniawski, 1967) showed that crack propagation starts with

low velocity and grows up to the point in which the elastic energy released

by crack development is insufficient to maintain crack propagation. This

results in a rapid increase of crack velocity, until a terminal velocity

is reached which is about one half of the shear wave velocity. The measurement

of a terminal velocity of 1875 ms-<sup><font size="-1">1</font></sup> permits

to evaluate the limit number </font><font face="Symbol">n</font><font face="Tahoma"><sub><font size="-1">L</font></sub>

of cracking events per unit time. By assuming a lattice constant of a few

Å the order of magnitude of </font><font face="Symbol">n</font><font face="Tahoma"><sub><font size="-1">L</font></sub>

lies between 10<sup><font size="-1">12</font></sup> and 10<sup><font size="-1">13</font></sup>

s-<sup><font size="-1">1</font></sup>. Both analytical and numerical solutions

for the dynamics of earthquakes in model systems give a power law distribution

for the number n of failure events, n being related to the released elastic

earthquake energy E by a law of the type n ~ E-<sup>c</sup> with c ~ 1.

These models indicate that the empirical law (1) is due to the self-organised

critical behaviour of earthquakes (Chakrabarti and Benguigui, 1997).</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">The crack propagation process generates elastic

shock waves which travel in the rock. Detection of such waves permits the

observation of microfracturing (Scholz, 1968). However, very little is

known about the frequency spectrum of elastic shock waves produced during

microfracturing except that the spectra are very wide and are characterised

by a large amount of low frequencies (Mogi, 1973). The elastic shock activity

depends also on the mechanical and structural inhomogeneities and it was

found that the more heterogeneous the rock is, the greater is the elastic

shock activity during compression (Mogi, 1973). The microfracturing stage

is characterized also by a flurry of activity which occurs at low stresses;

as stress increases, this activity, at first, slows down to a very low

level, then begins to increase again at stress values which are approximately

half the fracture stress. Its rate increases until just before fracture

with a very rapid acceleration (Scholz, 1968). In a study of acoustic emissions

from rapidly moving cracks in glass and polymethyl methacrylate (known

as PMMA or Plexiglass or Perspex) (Gross, 1993) it was estimated that about

3% of the energy of an advancing crack is converted in acoustic emissions.

In the present work we suppose that a fraction of the elastic energy stored

in the rocks could be converted into electromagnetic energy, with mechanisms

which will be discussed in the next section. Even if the fraction of energy

were small and the radiation mechanism had small efficiency, it is estimated

that an appreciable amount of electromagnetic energy could propagate towards

the Earth surface and above it. This energy, in form of electromagnetic

waves, as will be discussed below, could be detected as radio signals at

the Earth surface.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">Above about half the fracture strength the stress-strain

curve is no more linear. This is the stress region in which dilatancy,

iii) stage, occurs. In laboratory experiments dilatancy corresponds to

an increase of volume of rocks, with increase of stress, due to the formation

of new void space produced by cracking. In rocks of the Earth crust the

dilatancy is accompanied by the flow of pore water in the dilated region

with increase of internal pressure and reduction of internal friction and

electrical resistivity.</font>

<p><font face="Tahoma"><font color="#FF6600"><font size="+2">4. GENERATION

OF ELECTROMAGNETIC SIGNALS</font></font></font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">Recently Mognaschi and Zezza (Mognaschi, 2000) observed

that a possible mechanism for the generation of electromagnetic waves in

the litosphere is to be identified with the microfracturing process of

rocks. These microfractures, in turn, involve the breaking of a large number

of atomic bonds, i.e. the covalent or ionic bonds giving rise to the crystalline

structure of the rocks. The formation of unbalanced charge distributions,

of opposite sign, on the opposite sides of the microfractures is to be

expected and, consequently, the onset of strong local electric fields.

The existence of such fields was demonstrated in experiments, performed

under vacuum, on the breaking of adhesion bonds. Potential differences

reaching 10<sup><font size="-1">4</font></sup> V were estimated from the

spectrum of X-rays emissions with a flux of 10<sup><font size="-1">9</font></sup>

photons cm-<sup><font size="-1">2</font></sup> (Klyuev, 1984).</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">In fracture experiments performed in air at atmospheric

pressure, rocks usually contain microcavities with adsorbed gases, it is

therefore possible that the breakdown voltage of the gases can be locally

exceeded with consequent generation of micro electrical discharges and

emission of electromagnetic waves.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">Another mechanism has also been suggested (Mognaschi,

2000) which could be effective in the fracture of rocks which are poor

conductors of electricity. The electric charges of opposite sign, created

on opposite sides of microfractures, constitute electric dipoles which

have a lifetime determined by the electrical relaxation time of the material.

Such dipoles have a linear dimension corresponding to the width of the

microfracture. This dimension can be modulated by the damped mechanical

vibrations, originated by rupture of the atomic bonds, of its walls giving

rise to dipole oscillations.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">The electric relaxation time </font><font face="Symbol">t</font><font face="Tahoma">

is the vacuum permittivity and </font><font face="Symbol">e</font><font face="Tahoma"><sub><font size="-1">r</font></sub>

the relative permittivity of the material. The values of </font><font face="Symbol">e</font><font face="Tahoma"><sub><font size="-1">r</font></sub>

of rocks mainly lie in the range from about 4 to 16 for dry rocks and can

reach values up to 50 in wet rocks, but values as high as 1000 are also

reported (Parkomenko, 1967) for some minerals. Resistivity of rocks, on

the contrary, varies over a range much wider than any other physical property.

Values as low as 10<sup><font size="-1">2</font></sup> </font><font face="Symbol">W</font><font face="Tahoma">

m in wet rocks and as high as 10<sup><font size="-1">18</font></sup> </font><font face="Symbol">W</font><font face="Tahoma">

m in some dry marbles are reported (Parkomenko, 1967). Relaxation times

ranging from 0.1 s in limestone and dolomite and 0.8 s in glacial till

are common values, although values short as 10-<sup><font size="-1">5</font></sup>

s can be estimated for wet gneiss (Parkomenko, 1967).</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">A relaxation time of tenths of seconds is sufficiently

long to allow for the efficiency of the proposed mechanism based on the

oscillation of the electric dipoles generated by the fracture process.

Taking into account the crack dynamics, which involves a finite speed of

propagation of cracks and crack branching, the number of dipoles generated

should increase with time so that a very large number of dipoles, increasing

with time, is expected to be present, even if each of them have a limited

lifetime. During the fracture process mechanical vibrations, arising from

the breaking of atomic bonds within the material, give origin to the well

known mechanical damped acoustic and ultra-acoustic vibrations. Such vibrations

can also produce oscillations of the electrical dipoles localised along

the microfractures. The resulting damped electrical dipole oscillations

will, in turn, give rise to electromagnetic waves.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">In the case of rocks containing piezoelectric components,

like e.g. quartz, electromagnetic emissions can be generated by the process

of recombination of electric charges induced by stress release (Matsuda

<i>et

al</i>., 2001). This last mechanism could be active only in rocks containing

a substantial amount of such components.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">A model which takes into account the dislocation

dynamics in the preseismic micro-crackings located in an earthquake preparation

zone was recently developed (Teisseyre, 2002) to explain high noise levels

in VLF and ULF bands frequently observed before earthquakes (Meloni <i>et

al</i>., 2001).</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">Whatever the mechanism of generation of electromagnetic

waves, our model consists of a large number of small electric dipoles whose

linear dimensions d are those of the width of the fracture which perform

damped oscillations. Electromagnetic emissions should start with the beginning

of the microfracturing process, so that the number of dipoles involved

should reach, at the end of the process, the number N of broken bonds.

However, since not all the bonds are fractured simultaneously, the instantaneous

number of broken bonds will depend on the dynamics of fracture and will

be substantially lower than N.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">Experimental evidence of electromagnetic emissions

before the fracture and at the fracture of rocks, crystals and various

insulating or quasi conducting materials are well documented in literature.

The first report of this phenomenon was given in the 17th century by Otto

von Guericke (de Guericke, 1672) who, describing the electrical discharges

observed through rubbing on a sulphur globe, says "...it shines in the

same way as crushed sugar." Indeed, it is easy to observe, in the dark,

the light flashes by crushing transparent crystals like those of sugar.

Visible photons during deformation, and prior to failure of MgO single

crystals, were detected (Langford, 1987), while electromagnetic emissions

from cracked granite were observed (Warwick, 1982). Recently it has been

reported the detection of radio noise signals at 500 kHz and at 200 kHz

in fracture experiments on gneiss (Mognaschi, 2000). These experiments

were performed by applying an uniaxial stress which increased uniformly

from zero to rock failure in about 90 s. A magnetic antenna of 107 turns,

wound on a ferrite rod, was placed near the gneiss block under uniaxial

stress. The antenna, shielded from external noise sources, was connected

a tape and then analysed with a dynamic signal analyser Hewlett-Packard

35665A. The time acquisition capability of the spectrum analyser being

limited to four seconds, only such time interval is shown in fig. 2. Macroscopic

failure of the sample corresponds to the big signal to the right, which

lasts about .4 s. Other signals are visible before rock failure. The time

Earth crust is, of course, a non-homogeneous medium since different layers

<p><font face="Tahoma"><font color="#FF6600"><font size="+2">6. FINAL REMARKS

AND CONCLUSIONS ON THE DETECTABILITY OF ELECTROMAGNETIC PRECURSORS</font></font></font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">Under suitable conditions the low frequency electromagnetic

waves, generated in the rocks of the Earth crust under tectonic stresses

of the order of about a half of those needed for rock failure (and consequent

generation of seismic shocks) can propagate in the lithosphere and reach,

as seen previously, wide regions over the Earth surface. However, two distinct

paths are possible: i) a path SAB which is partially underground and partially

in the atmosphere as a lateral wave; ii) a direct underground path SB,

see fig. 3. In path i) there is attenuation due to the conductivity of

the medium in the underground part, which practically coincides with the

depth D of the source since </font><font face="Symbol">y</font><font face="Tahoma"><sub><font size="-1">L</font></sub>

is usually small, while practically no such attenuation occurs in the atmospheric

part of the path; as for path ii), which is of length R, the same attenuation

factor is present as in the first part of path i) provided that the medium

is homogeneous and isotropic.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">The power spectral density of electromagnetic waves

produced by damped oscillations is practically independent on frequency

at low frequencies, see eq. (5), while the wave attenuation in the underground

path is lower for the lower frequencies, see eq. (12). On the other hand,

natural electromagnetic noise of galactic origin increases with the inverse

of frequency. From these considerations one can deduce that it should exist

a frequency range, a "window" (Dea <i>et al</i>., 1993), for which a compromise

between wave attenuation and increase of natural noise would give the best

chance in the detection of electromagnetic precursors. Such a frequency

range would, of course, depend also on the electrical properties of the

rocks in the underground path.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">Earthquake electromagnetic precursors events were

defined by Dea <i>et al</i>. (Dea <i>et al</i>., 1993) as "events with

elevated broad-band signals in the 0.1-20 Hz region appearing several hours

to several days in advance of moderate to large earthquakes". The same

authors have published recordings and data on the increase of power spectra

noise in the 1-5 Hz range that were taken one or two days before many moderate

magnitude earthquakes in California.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">If we consider again the propagation in wet granite

from (12) we have at 3 Hz,</font><font face="Symbol"> <nobr>b</nobr></font><nobr><font face="Tahoma">

= 5.2 </font><font face="Symbol">´</font><font face="Tahoma"> 10-<sup><font size="-1">5</font></sup>

Np m-<sup><font size="-1">1</font></sup></font></nobr><font face="Tahoma">.

Assuming for the source depth D the maximum value of 60 km and <nobr>AB

= 80 km</nobr> the attenuation due to the conductivity of medium 1, would

be - 27 dB for path i), and - 45 dB for path ii), respectively. To such

attenuation one must add the geometrical field attenuation due to propagation

of, e.g., spherical waves. If we admit a radius of one kilometre for the

source of spherical waves and we consider a path SB of about 100 km the

1/r factor for the decrease of field intensity will contribute an attenuation

of - 40 dB so that the overall attenuation for path ii) will be - 85 dB.

As concerns path i), the total attenuation is the sum of that in SA due

to conductivity, which amounts to - 27 dB, plus the one due to geometrical

field attenuation of spherical waves, which amounts to - 36 dB, plus that

of lateral waves in AB, which amounts to - 14 dB. The overall attenuation

along path i) being - 77 dB, which is lower than that along path ii) previously

calculated. The attenuation along path ii) is, therefore, the one which

impose constraints to the detectability of electromagnetic waves.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">The field intensity at the receiving station must

be, of course, greater than the natural radio noise. Assuming an average

level for the natural noise, in the frequency interval from 1 to 3 Hz,

of <nobr>1 </nobr></font><nobr><font face="Symbol">m</font><font face="Tahoma">Vm-<sup><font size="-1">1</font></sup></font></nobr><font face="Tahoma">,

an attenuation of - 85 dB requires that the power of an hypothetical isotropic

radiator at the source, supposed in free space, should be of about 50 kW

in order to produce an electromagnetic field greater than <nobr>1 </nobr></font><nobr><font face="Symbol">m</font><font face="Tahoma">Vm-<sup><font size="-1">1</font></sup></font></nobr><font face="Tahoma">

at the receiving station. This estimated power is rather small compared

with the huge powers involved in microfracturing of geological structures

of the Earth crust, so that it is not unlikely the existence of mechanisms,

as discussed in section 4, which could generate electromagnetic waves with

the required strength.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">On the other hand, lateral waves travel in air at

about the light speed c, while underground propagation takes place at speed

<nobr>v

= c/n<sub>E</sub></nobr> which could be much lower than c. The time delay

between signals which travelled along the two paths, in the case considered,

is mainly determined by the difference of length between the two underground

paths <nobr>SA </nobr></font><nobr><font face="Symbol">@</font><font face="Tahoma">

D = 60 km</font></nobr><font face="Tahoma"> and <nobr>SB </nobr></font><nobr><font face="Symbol">@</font><font face="Tahoma">

100 km</font></nobr><font face="Tahoma">, and amounts to 100 ms, a time

delay easily measurable.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">It could be possible, by means of a network of stations,

to localise impending earthquakes through the time delay of arrival of

the two types of waves, provided the speed of the underground electromagnetic

waves is known at least to the same relative accuracy with which the speeds

of elastic waves in the lithosphere are known.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">As for the detection of electromagnetic precursors

by means of a couple of electrodes driven in the soil at a distance of

some tens or hundred of meters between them, the sum of electromotive forces

due to the horizontal components of the electric field of the waves which

have travelled along paths i) and ii) will be picked up and an analysis

of the time autocorrelation of the received signal is to be performed.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">At larger distances from the source S the attenuation

of underground waves will prevent their detection, while the lateral wave

could be still received.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">The treatment and the considerations developed in

the present paper were brought about with the aim of finding a theoretical

support to the explanation of the origin, propagation and detectability

of such electromagnetic precursors and eventually to propose a method to

localise their origin which could coincide with the focus of a forthcoming

earthquake. In presence of some experimental confirmations of the simple

model we propose, it would be worthwhile to afford a more realistic description

of the Earth structure and properties by taking into account other important

details as, for instance, the layered structure of the involved media.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">At present very effective methods of seismic exploration

are based on the recording and analysis of acoustic lateral waves. The

application of the same techniques to electromagnetic precursors of earthquakes

could be effective to predict where tectonic stresses have increased to

above a half of the failure value of rocks and hence to localise the focus

of a future earthquake; from the evaluation of the strength and a study

of the time evolution of such precursors, it could also be possible to

estimate in advance the earthquake magnitude and when the rocks failure,

which will originate an earthquake, will take place. To reach such goals

the dynamics of rocks fracture processes should be fully understood and

the data on electromagnetic precursors should be carefully collected and

analysed.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma">At present an experimental activity is under way

in order to analyse experimental data on the natural radio noise in the

ELF and ULF bands along the lines above outlined.</font>

</p><p><font face="Tahoma"><b><font color="#FF6600">Note added in proof</font></b>

- After the submission of this paper an experimental confirmation of the

previsions based on the above theoretical model was found in a recent paper

(Varotsos <i>et al</i>., 2001). A delay up to 1-2 s in the time of arrival

at the Ioannina station (at an epicentral distance of about 80 km) among

two kinds of electromagnetic signals was detected 3 weeks before the 6.6

Grevena-Kozani earthquake occurred on May 13, 1995. The first signal arrived

was detected as low frequency electric field variations, while the delayed

signals were detected as low frequency variations of magnetic field intensity

obtained at a sampling rate of 1 sample/sec. This time delay cannot be

attributed neither to the instrumentation, nor can be present in signals

due to nearby artificial sources. It could be explained as due to different

velocities of propagation of electromagnetic waves along different paths.</font>
