possible input method, effectively convert into images, apply convnets as if to animation

send radio signal through fft, windowed every 10mins (?), each window is a step on the y axis
divide into x bands
for each x,y the value at that point is (mean, peak, standard deviation) of the fft

can visualise as image rgb

...

easier still, use spectrograms!
