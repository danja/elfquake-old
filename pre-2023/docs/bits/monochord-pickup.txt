Out of curiosity I estimated the windings from the area of a cross section of the coil (see circle packing). This came out in the region of 600 turns, probably a little more. To check, I then estimated the length of wire used and from that the expected DC resistance. This came out around 34 ohms. Measuring the resistance yielded 45 ohms. Given that I hadn't taken into account the enamel coating on the wire and I'd gone for a low-end estimate, this sounds about right.
